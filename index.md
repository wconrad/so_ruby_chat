# Hello, fellow Rubyist!

Welcome to the [Stack Overflow (SO) Ruby Chat Room][2].  This is a
room where we hang out to talk about Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails and other
things.  Our main purpose isn't to answer Ruby questions (that's what
SO is for), but we try to help when we can.

## General behavior

* Be good to each other, as explained in the [No Code of Conduct (NCoC)][1]
  (warning: some language)
* Please keep language safe for work
* Please don't use @username notification unless you are already in a
  conversation with that person.
* We believe that the Ruby chatroom should be a friendly and welcoming
  place.  If you see misbehavior in the room, please @contact a room
  owner and we'll do our best to sort it out.

## Asking Questions

* You don't need to ask if anyone is around.  Just ask your question
  and someone will help if they are able.
* You may link to questions on SO.  If someone knows the answer, they
  will help.
* If nobody answers, please don't repeat your request.
* You may post short snippets of code into the room.  If it's big
  (say, over a dozen lines) please post a link to the code instead.
* Please format code appropriately: paste your text and indent it with
  control-K.  Or you can press the "fixed font" button that appears
  next to "send" and "upload" when your post is more than one line
  line.
* Don't star posts to reward users for answering your question.

## Unacceptable Topics

* Don't promote illegal activities, including piracy of software or
  books.
