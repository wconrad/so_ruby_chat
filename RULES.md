Welcome to the [Stack Overflow (SO) Ruby Chat Room][2].  This is a
room where we hang out to talk about Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails and other
things.  Our main purpose isn't to answer Ruby questions (that's what
SO is for), but we try to help when we can.

# General behavior

* Be good to each other: [NCoC][1] (warning: some language)

* Please keep language safe for work

* Please don't use @username notification unless you are already in a
  conversation with that person.

* We believe that the Ruby chatroom should be a friendly and welcoming
  place.  If you see misbheavior in the room, please @contact a room
  owner and we'll do our best to sort it out.

# Asking Questions

* You don't need to ask if anyone is around.  Just ask your question
  and someone will help if they are able.

* You may link to questions on SO.  If someone knows the answer, they
  will help.

* If nobody answers, please don't repeat your request.

* You may post short snippets of code into the room.  If it's big
  (say, over a dozen lines) please post a link to the code instead.

* Please format code appropriately: paste your text and indent it with
  control-K.  Or, highlight the text and press the "fixed font" button
  that appears next to "send" and "upload" when your post is more than
  one line line.

* Don't star posts to reward users for answering your question.
